# 🎨 Week 2 – Getting Into CSS: Making Things Look Good

This week is where things start to get a lot more fun. Now that I’ve got a solid grip on HTML, it’s time to bring in **CSS** — the part that makes websites look *good*.

## 💡 What's CSS All About?

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is basically how you style a web page. While HTML is all about structure and content, CSS is where design lives — fonts, colors, layout, spacing, and even cool stuff like hover effects.

So this week, I’m learning how to:

- **Change fonts and text styling**  
  Playing with font sizes, families, weights, and line spacing to get the look and feel just right.

- **Add colors**  
  Giving life to elements with background colors, text colors, and learning how to pick color combos that actually work.

- **Create hover effects**  
  Making buttons and links respond when someone hovers over them — small touches that make a big difference.

## 🧩 Putting It All Together

By the end of this week, I’ll take what I learned in Week 1 (HTML) and combine it with all this new CSS knowledge to build my **first full app**. Not just a demo or an experiment — a real, functional app that looks and feels intentional.

## 🔁 The Goal

I'm not just learning syntax or copying code. I want to really understand how CSS works, how it fits with HTML, and how to control the way my app looks — down to the smallest detail. It’s about getting hands-on, making mistakes, and building something I’m proud of.
